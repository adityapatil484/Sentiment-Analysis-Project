                "description": "Travis Kelce started Eighty-Seven & Running because of what he saw during his childhood. Growing up in the diverse suburb of Cleveland Heights, Ohio, his community transcended normal economic and cultural boundaries; merging rich and poor, black and white, and different religious affiliations into one big melting pot. Because of this he noticed some of his closest friends didn\u2019t have the same family structure he was blessed with, and weren\u2019t able to enjoy the same experiences.\n\nWhile he was supported by \u201cthe village\u201d of family and individuals in the community, Kelce struggled in school and at times lacked the motivation to keep going. Many of the people he considered role models in the community never came back to support their hometown once they reached success. Because of these experiences, Kelce felt obligated to provide opportunities to disadvantaged youth and to help them aspire beyond their current situations. Now as tight end #87 for the Kansas City Chiefs, Kelce\u2019s passion for changing the plight of youth experiencing adversity is the inspiration behind Eighty-Seven & Running.\n\nEighty-Seven & Running helps underserved youth strive to become productive citizens by mentoring and motivating them to explore and develop their abilities while learning critical life skills. Founded in 2015, we have remained dedicated to providing resources and enrichment opportunities for youth and their communities through fundraising, athletic programs, mentoring, and outreach initiatives.\"\n\nSubscribe to our channel! http://youtube.com/nike\n\nNike strives to bring innovation and inspiration to every athlete* in the world.

                    "description": "Travis Kelce started Eighty-Seven & Running because of what he saw during his childhood. Growing up in the diverse suburb of Cleveland Heights, Ohio, his community transcended normal economic and cultural boundaries; merging rich and poor, black and white, and different religious affiliations into one big melting pot. Because of this he noticed some of his closest friends didn\u2019t have the same family structure he was blessed with, and weren\u2019t able to enjoy the same experiences.\n\nWhile he was supported by \u201cthe village\u201d of family and individuals in the community, Kelce struggled in school and at times lacked the motivation to keep going. Many of the people he considered role models in the community never came back to support their hometown once they reached success. Because of these experiences, Kelce felt obligated to provide opportunities to disadvantaged youth and to help them aspire beyond their current situations. Now as tight end #87 for the Kansas City Chiefs, Kelce\u2019s passion for changing the plight of youth experiencing adversity is the inspiration behind Eighty-Seven & Running.\n\nEighty-Seven & Running helps underserved youth strive to become productive citizens by mentoring and motivating them to explore and develop their abilities while learning critical life skills. Founded in 2015, we have remained dedicated to providing resources and enrichment opportunities for youth and their communities through fundraising, athletic programs, mentoring, and outreach initiatives.\"\n\nSubscribe to our channel! http://youtube.com/nike\n\nNike strives to bring innovation and inspiration to every athlete* in the world.

In this guide, you\u2019ll learn a variety of ways to interact with nature, all designed to bring you a measure of peace from the hectic day to day grind. We encourage you to pause the video throughout, testing our methods in your nearby park or other favorite outdoor place. You can leave the video paused for days, weeks, months, or even years, while you set out with our handy how-tos. However long it takes you, we hope you will share your peaceful findings with us. \n\nHandy Guides contained in this video:\n\nHow To: Forget Your Phone: You don\u2019t need your phone. When you\u2019re in nature, you\u2019ll quickly find it easy to relax and enjoy yourself without a digital device.\n\nHow To: Soak It All In: Slow down. Take a pause and use your senses. What do you hear? What do you smell? What do you see?\n\nHow To: Respect Your Mother: The planet is a living, breathing being. Her name is Earth and she\u2019s your mother.\n\nHow To: Nature on the Daily: The benefits of nature are clear when you experience them. Not everyone can pack up the bus and make the trek to Smith Rock, though, and that\u2019s ok.\n\nThat\u2019s a lot of peace. And for even more, why not follow ACG on the Nike app: https://nike.app.link/1pfWplyfZa \n\nSubscribe to our channel! http://youtube.com/nike\n\nNike strives to bring innovation and inspiration to every athlete* in the world.

                    "description": "Peace. It means different things to different people. But here at ACG, we are committed to helping you find it. We believe that search starts in nature. In this guide, you\u2019ll learn a variety of ways to interact with nature, all designed to bring you a measure of peace from the hectic day to day grind. We encourage you to pause the video throughout, testing our methods in your nearby park or other favorite outdoor place. You can leave the video paused for days, weeks, months, or even years, while you set out with our handy how-tos. However long it takes you, we hope you will share your peaceful findings with us. \n\nHandy Guides contained in this video:\n\nHow To: Forget Your Phone: You don\u2019t need your phone. When you\u2019re in nature, you\u2019ll quickly find it easy to relax and enjoy yourself without a digital device.\n\nHow To: Soak It All In: Slow down. Take a pause and use your senses. What do you hear? What do you smell? What do you see?\n\nHow To: Respect Your Mother: The planet is a living, breathing being. Her name is Earth and she\u2019s your mother.\n\nHow To: Nature on the Daily: The benefits of nature are clear when you experience them. Not everyone can pack up the bus and make the trek to Smith Rock, though, and that\u2019s ok.\n\nThat\u2019s a lot of peace. And for even more, why not follow ACG on the Nike app: https://nike.app.link/1pfWplyfZa \n\nSubscribe to our channel! http://youtube.com/nike\n\nNike strives to bring innovation and inspiration to every athlete* in the world.

Can she earn the title \u201cChef Colleen\u201d? \n\nFree-Range Pizza \n\nIngredients (Serves 2): \n1 long, thin eggplant  \nKosher salt \n\u00bd cup olive oil  \n1 bunch curly kale, stems removed, roughly chopped \nFreshly ground black pepper  \n\u00bc cup all-purpose flour \n\u00bd lb pre-made pizza dough \n4\u20138 oz fresh ricotta \n2 cloves garlic  \n1\u00bd cups shredded asiago cheese \n3 large eggs  \n2 cups balsamic vinegar \n\u00bd cup brown sugar \nNutritional yeast \n\nTools: \nLarge knife \nCutting board \nLarge saut\u00e9 pan \nTongs \nSheet pan \nRolling pin \nPizza pan \nBox grater \nSmall pot \nWhisk \n\nMethod: \nPreheat the oven to 500 degrees. Slice the eggplant into \u00bc-inch rounds or half moons. Sprinkle the slices with salt and lay them on a wire rack set over a baking sheet or on a few layers of paper towels so the excess moisture can drain out. Meanwhile, heat 1 tablespoon of olive oil in the large saut\u00e9 pan over medium-high, then add the kale and saut\u00e9, tossing with the tongs, for about 4 minutes. Season with salt and pepper. Set the kale aside. \n\nSpread the eggplant evenly on the sheet pan, drizzle with olive oil, and roast for 5 to 6 minutes, flipping halfway through. Meanwhile, spread the flour on a clean surface. Spread the pizza dough out and, using your rolling pin and your hands, begin to work it into a 12-inch circle. Drizzle olive oil on the pizza pan, carefully transfer the dough to the pan, and drizzle olive oil on top. \n\nTake the eggplant out of the oven. Dollop the ricotta on the pizza dough. Lower the heat to 450. Top the pizza dough with the eggplant and kale, then season with salt and pepper. Using the wide side of your box grater or a mandolin, thinly slice the garlic. Top the pizza dough with the asiago cheese. \n\nBake the pizza for 12 minutes. Top with sliced garlic, crack the eggs over the top, and bake for another 3 minutes or until the whites are cooked. Meanwhile, add the balsamic vinegar and brown sugar to the small pot and whisk over medium-high heat until the mixture begins to thicken. Remove the pizza from the oven, drizzle with a spoonful of balsamic reduction, sprinkle with nutritional yeast, and finish with salt and pepper. \n\nMore nutrition info from athletes and experts: https://go.nike.com/Coaching\n\nSubscribe to our channel! http://youtube.com/nike\n\nNike strives to bring innovation and inspiration to every athlete* in the world.
